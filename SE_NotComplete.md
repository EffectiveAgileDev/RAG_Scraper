# RAG Scraper - NOT COMPLETE Features (No tests, Failing tests, or Skipped tests)

## Known Defects

### Test Failures
1. **Manual Testing Defect Resolution**: `test_unknown_error_in_scraping_defect` still fails
2. **Missing File**: `test_mobimag_extraction.py` referenced but does not exist

### UI Layout and Usability Defects
3. **AI Settings Panel Space Issue**: The space allowed for the AI section of Advanced Options is not sufficient and cuts off the save options (visual truncation issue)
4. **Results Display Layout**: Move the output of the scrape up under the Scraping Results section. Move the Advanced_Options header to the left to be over the advanced options section
5. **AI Enhancement Section Reorganization**: Create a new section on the right next to the Advanced_Options for AI_Enhancement_Options and move all AI enhancement controls under it for better organization and visibility
6. ~~**AI Enhancement Checkbox State Not Recognized**: AI Enhancement checkbox appears checked but system shows "No AI settings to save (AI enhancement is disabled)"~~ ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Root Cause**: JavaScript selector mismatch - looking for `input[name="scraping_mode"]` but HTML uses `name="scrapingMode"`
   - **Solution**: Fixed selector in `getAIConfiguration()` function and updated default mode to multi-page
   - **Status**: Resolved - all related tests passing
7. **HTML Rendering Bug in API Key Section**: Literal string 'autocomplete="off" />' appears as visible text in the UI under the API key input field
   - **Symptoms**: Raw HTML code displayed as text instead of being parsed as HTML attribute
   - **Location**: AI Enhancement panel, API key input section
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Visual defect affecting user experience

### File Upload AI Enhancement Integration Defects
6. **AI Enhancement Not Working for File Uploads**: Despite AI enhancement being enabled and configured, AI analysis is not appearing in JSON output files for uploaded PDFs
   - **Symptoms**: 
     - Log shows "AI enhancement succeeded for text 1, extractions: 3" but no AI analysis in output JSON
     - "AI enhancement failed for text 1, error: Malformed API response" errors
     - OpenAI API returns 401 "Incorrect API key provided" errors
     - No charges appearing on OpenAI account indicating API calls aren't working
   - **Root Cause Analysis Needed**: 
     - Invalid OpenAI API key causing authentication failures
     - AI analysis data not being properly attached to RestaurantData objects
     - JSON generator not finding ai_analysis field in restaurant data
     - Inconsistent field naming between file upload and multi-page implementations
   - **Test Status**: Manual testing shows AI enhancement works for multi-page scraping but fails for file uploads
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Core AI functionality broken for file upload feature

### AI API Integration Defects
7. **OpenAI API Key Authentication Failure**: New OpenAI API key generated but still returns 401 authentication errors
   - **Symptoms**:
     - User generated new API key but still experiencing authentication failures
     - 401 "Incorrect API key provided" errors persist with new key
     - Both single-page and multi-page modes affected
     - No charges appearing on OpenAI account indicating API calls aren't reaching OpenAI servers
     - Scraping succeeds but no AI analysis data appears in JSON output files
   - **Root Cause Analysis Needed**:
     - API key format validation and proper transmission to OpenAI API
     - Network connectivity or proxy issues preventing API calls
     - OpenAI API endpoint configuration or request formatting issues
     - Session storage or configuration management not properly handling new API key
   - **Test Status**: Manual testing with both old and new API keys shows consistent authentication failures
   - **Priority**: HIGH - Core AI functionality completely non-functional
   - **PLANNED FIX**: Add "Check Key" button next to API key input that validates the key using OpenAI's `/models` endpoint before saving settings
8. ~~**Missing Model Selection Dropdown**: Users cannot select which specific model to use with their chosen LLM provider~~ ✅ **IMPLEMENTED**
