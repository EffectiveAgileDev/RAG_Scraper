## Critical Issues

### PDF Processing
- **Status**: Returns hardcoded data only
- **Tests**: All 19 PDF tests SKIPPED (not testing real functionality)
- **Impact**: Cannot process actual PDF files

### Missing Implementations
1. **Phase 3.2**: Semantic Content Structuring - No code or tests
2. **Phase 3.3**: Customer Intent Mapping - No code or tests
3. **PDF Processing**: Mock implementation only
4. **UI Integration**: File upload not in main interface

### Test Issues
- **Skipped Tests**: Don't validate functionality
- **Missing Tests**: Referenced but don't exist
- **Failing Test**: `test_unknown_error_in_scraping_defect`

## Immediate Priorities
1. Fix failing test in Phase 3.4
2. Implement real PDF text extraction (replace mocks)
3. Integrate file upload UI into main web interface
4. Implement Phase 3.2 and 3.3 features
5. Replace all SKIPPED tests with real tests
