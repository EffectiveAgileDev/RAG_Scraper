# RAG Scraper - NOT COMPLETE Features (No tests, Failing tests, or Skipped tests)

## Known Defects

### Test Failures
1. **Manual Testing Defect Resolution**: `test_unknown_error_in_scraping_defect` still fails **FIXED**
2. **Missing File**: `test_mobimag_extraction.py` referenced but does not exist **FIXED**

### UI Layout and Usability Defects
3. **AI Settings Panel Space Issue**: The space allowed for the AI section of Advanced Options is not sufficient and cuts off the save options (visual truncation issue)**FIXED**
4. **Results Display Layout**: Move the output of the scrape up under the Scraping Results section. Move the Advanced_Options header to the left to be over the advanced options section **FIXED**
5. **AI Enhancement Section Reorganization**: Create a new section on the right next to the Advanced_Options for AI_Enhancement_Options and move all AI enhancement controls under it for better organization and visibility  **FIXED**
6. ~~**AI Enhancement Checkbox State Not Recognized**: AI Enhancement checkbox appears checked but system shows "No AI settings to save (AI enhancement is disabled)"~~ ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Root Cause**: JavaScript selector mismatch - looking for `input[name="scraping_mode"]` but HTML uses `name="scrapingMode"` **FIXED**
   - **Solution**: Fixed selector in `getAIConfiguration()` function and updated default mode to multi-page
   - **Status**: Resolved - all related tests passing
7. **HTML Rendering Bug in API Key Section**: Literal string 'autocomplete="off" />' appears as visible text in the UI under the API key input field **FIXED**
   - **Symptoms**: Raw HTML code displayed as text instead of being parsed as HTML attribute
   - **Location**: AI Enhancement panel, API key input section
   - **Priority**: MEDIUM - Visual defect affecting user experience

8. ~~**Load Settings JavaScript Error**: "updateSliderValue is not defined" error when clicking "Load Settings" button~~ ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Solution**: Fixed JavaScript function name typo and element ID references
   - **Status**: Load Settings button now works correctly without errors

     - OpenAI API returns 401 "Incorrect API key provided" errors
     - No charges appearing on OpenAI account indicating API calls aren't working
   - **Root Cause Analysis Needed**: 
     - Invalid OpenAI API key causing authentication failures
     - AI analysis data not being properly attached to RestaurantData objects
     - JSON generator not finding ai_analysis field in restaurant data
     - Inconsistent field naming between file upload and multi-page implementations

#### Remaining Tasks: ❌
1. **UI Polish**
   - [ ] Add visual indicators in results when AI enhancement is active
   - [ ] Implement AI confidence badges in results display
   - [ ] Add toggle to show/hide AI-enhanced information in results

#### AI Settings Persistence Issues: ✅ FIXED
9. ~~**Model Dropdown Disabled After Settings Load**: Model selection becomes non-functional after loading saved AI settings~~ ✅ **FIXED**
   - **Solution**: Modified `refreshModels()` to use saved API key from backend when no typed key exists
   - **Status**: Users can now change models without re-entering API key
   
10. ~~**API Key Visibility Toggle Non-Functional**: API key show/hide button stops working after settings load~~ ✅ **FIXED**
    - **Solution**: Disabled toggle for saved keys (security feature), re-enables when user types new key
    - **Status**: Working as designed - saved keys cannot be revealed for security
    
11. ~~**Provider Change Loses API Key**: Changing LLM provider after loading settings loses saved API key~~ ✅ **FIXED**
    - **Solution**: This is expected behavior - different providers require different API keys
    - **Status**: Working as designed - each provider maintains its own API key

12. ~~**Clear Settings Button Clears Entire Form**: Clicking Clear Saved was hiding all AI settings panels~~ ✅ **FIXED**
    - **Solution**: Modified to only clear saved settings indicators, not reset/hide the form
    - **Status**: Clear button now works correctly without affecting current form data

13. ~~**Settings Auto-Load on Page Refresh Not Working**: Settings saved but not loading automatically~~ ✅ **FIXED**
    - **Solution**: Fixed mode detection to apply settings to currently visible UI mode
    - **Status**: Settings now auto-load correctly regardless of saved vs current mode

14. **Confusing Save Buttons**: "Save Settings" vs "Make Permanent" unclear to users ✅ **IMPROVED**
    - **Solution**: Added tooltips and renamed buttons:
      - "Save Current Settings" - saves when AI enabled
      - "Save All Permanently" - saves regardless of AI state
    - **Status**: Clearer labels and hover tooltips explain functionality

2. **Custom Question Enhancement** ✅ COMPLETE
   - [x] **Add user-customizable question input** - Added textarea with 200 char limit per question to AI settings panel
   - [x] **Include custom questions in AI analysis** - Custom questions are saved and included in AI extraction prompts
   - [x] **User-specified information extraction** - Users can add multiple custom questions (one per line)
   - [x] **Working examples**: Current saved settings include "Do you have any baby highchairs?", "Do you serve custom made cocktails?", "Do you serve brunch on weekends?"
   - **Implementation**: Both single-page and multi-page modes have custom questions textarea with validation

2. **API Key and Provider Enhancements** ✅ COMPLETE
   - [x] **Make API key not obfuscate during entry** - Changed API key input from `type="password"` to `type="text"` with toggle visibility button
   - [x] **Allow API key length to be whatever the user entered** - Removed all length restrictions and validation constraints, accepts any non-empty string
   - [x] **Add ability to add generic providers using OpenAI model** - Added custom OpenAI-compatible provider with configuration for Provider Name, Base URL, and Model Name

#### Design Principles Achieved: ✅
- **Hidden by Default**: AI features are collapsed/hidden unless explicitly enabled ✅
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Traditional scraping works perfectly without AI ✅
- **Clear Indicators**: Users know when AI features are active/inactive ✅
- **Secure Configuration**: API keys handled securely in session storage ✅
