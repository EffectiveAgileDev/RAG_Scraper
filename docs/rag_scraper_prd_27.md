## 9. Technical Challenges and Solutions

### 9.1 Challenge: Dynamic Content Loading
**Problem**: Many restaurant websites use JavaScript to load content dynamically
**Solution**: 
- Primary: Static HTML parsing for faster processing
- Fallback: Selenium WebDriver for JavaScript-heavy sites
- Detection: Analyze page size and content indicators to determine approach
**TDD Approach**: Write tests first for both static and dynamic content scenarios, mock different website response types, ensure graceful fallback behavior is thoroughly tested

### 9.2 Challenge: Inconsistent Website Structures
**Problem**: Restaurant websites vary significantly in structure and design
**Solution**:
- Multi-strategy extraction: JSON-LD → microdata → heuristic patterns
- Common selector patterns for restaurant data
- Machine learning-based content classification (future enhancement)
- Manual pattern addition for commonly encountered structures
**TDD Approach**: Create comprehensive test suite with diverse HTML structures, use parameterized tests for multiple extraction strategies, mock various website layouts to ensure robust extraction logic

### 9.3 Challenge: Rate Limiting and IP Blocking
**Problem**: Some websites may block or limit scraping attempts
**Solution**:
- Respectful rate limiting (2-second delays between requests)
- Random user agent rotation
- Request header management to appear as regular browser traffic
- Graceful handling of 429 (Too Many Requests) responses
**TDD Approach**: Test rate limiting logic with mocked HTTP responses, verify retry mechanisms with controlled failure scenarios, ensure proper delay timing through time-based testing

### 9.4 Challenge: Data Quality and Validation
**Problem**: Extracted data may be incomplete or incorrectly formatted
**Solution**:
- Multi-level validation: format validation → content validation → completeness checks
- Confidence scoring for extracted fields
- Manual review flags for uncertain extractions
- Standardization functions for common format variations
**TDD Approach**: Implement test-first validation rules for each data field, create comprehensive test datasets with edge cases, validate data quality metrics through assertions, test standardization functions with various input formats

### 9.5 Challenge: Multi-Page Website Navigation and Data Aggregation
**Problem**: Restaurant websites often spread information across multiple pages (Home, Menu, Contact, About, Hours) requiring intelligent navigation and data consolidation
**Solution**:
- **Intelligent page discovery**: Analyze navigation menus and common link patterns
- **Page type classification**: Categorize discovered pages by content type and relevance
- **Data deduplication**: Prevent duplicate information when same data appears on multiple pages
- **Progress transparency**: Keep users informed of multi-page processing status
- **Graceful page failures**: Continue processing other pages when individual pages fail
- **Content prioritization**: Use most authoritative source when conflicting data exists across pages
**TDD Approach**: Create comprehensive test suites for page discovery algorithms, mock various website navigation structures, test data aggregation logic with conflicting information scenarios, validate progress notification systems with multi-page workflows

### 9.6 Challenge: Test Data Management and Maintenance
**Problem**: Maintaining realistic test data for diverse restaurant website structures
**TDD Solution**:

## 12. Testing Strategy - Test Driven Development Approach

### 12.1 TDD Methodology Overview

**Core Principle**: All custom code development follows the Red-Green-Refactor cycle with near 100% test coverage for application-specific logic.

**Coverage Requirements**:
- **Custom Code Coverage**: 95-100% for all application-specific modules
- **Vendor Component Coverage**: 0% (Flask, BeautifulSoup, etc. are excluded from coverage requirements)
- **Integration Points**: 100% coverage for custom wrapper and adapter code

**TDD Definition of Custom Code**:
- All application business logic (restaurant data extraction, file generation)
- Custom configuration management and persistence
- User interface interaction logic
- Error handling and recovery mechanisms
- Plugin architecture and extensibility framework
- Data validation and normalization functions

**Excluded from Coverage Requirements**:
- Third-party libraries (Flask, BeautifulSoup4, requests, etc.)
- Standard Python library usage
- External service integrations (only test our wrapper code)

### 12.2 Red-Green-Refactor Implementation

#### 12.2.1 Red Phase - Write Failing Tests First
**Process**:
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Break down each feature into testable behaviors
2. **Test Case Design**: Write comprehensive test cases before any implementation
3. **Failure Validation**: Ensure tests fail for the expected reasons
4. **Test Documentation**: Document test intent and expected behaviors

**Test Categories for Red Phase**:
- **Unit Tests**: Individual function and method behavior
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and data flow
- **Acceptance Tests**: User story completion criteria
- **Edge Case Tests**: Boundary conditions and error scenarios

**Example Red Phase Process**:
```python
# Test written BEFORE implementation
def test_extract_restaurant_name_from_html():
    """Test restaurant name extraction from various HTML structures"""
    # Test Case 1: Standard h1 tag
    html_with_h1 = "<h1>Tony's Italian Restaurant</h1>"
    assert extract_restaurant_name(html_with_h1) == "Tony's Italian Restaurant"
    
    # Test Case 2: Title tag fallback
    html_with_title = "<title>Maria's Cantina - Authentic Mexican</title>"
    assert extract_restaurant_name(html_with_title) == "Maria's Cantina"
    
    # Test Case 3: No identifiable name
    html_no_name = "<div>Welcome to our restaurant</div>"
    assert extract_restaurant_name(html_no_name) == None
```

#### 12.2.2 Green Phase - Minimal Implementation
**Process**:
1. **Minimal Code**: Write only enough code to make tests pass
2. **No Premature Optimization**: Focus on functionality, not performance
3. **Test Validation**: Verify all tests pass with new implementation
4. **Coverage Verification**: Confirm 100% coverage of new code

**Green Phase Guidelines**:
- Implement the simplest solution that satisfies all test cases
- Use hard-coded values if they make tests pass (will be refactored later)
- Focus on correctness over elegance or efficiency
- Add logging and error handling only as required by tests

#### 12.2.3 Refactor Phase - Improve Code Quality
**Process**:
1. **Maintain Test Coverage**: All existing tests must continue to pass
2. **Code Quality Improvement**: Enhance readability, performance, and design
3. **Pattern Implementation**: Apply design patterns and best practices
4. **Documentation Updates**: Update code comments and documentation

**Refactor Focus Areas**:
- **Performance Optimization**: Improve efficiency without changing behavior
- **Code Duplication**: Extract common functionality into reusable components
- **Design Patterns**: Implement appropriate patterns (Strategy, Factory, etc.)
- **Error Handling**: Robust exception management and recovery

        assert len(progress_updates) >= 4  # Discovery + 3 pages
        
        # Validate aggregated data
        restaurant = results.successful_extractions[0]
        assert restaurant.name is not None  # From home page
        assert restaurant.menu_items is not None  # From menu page
        assert restaurant.phone is not None  # From contact page
```

#### 12.3.3 Acceptance Test Driven Development (ATDD)
**Coverage Target**: 100% of user story acceptance criteria
**Framework**: pytest-bdd for behavior-driven testing

**ATDD Process**:
1. **Write scenarios** in Gherkin format based on user stories
2. **Implement step definitions** using TDD approach
3. **Validate business requirements** through executable specifications

**Example ATDD Scenario**:
```gherkin
Feature: Restaurant Website Scraping
  As a RAG system administrator
  I want to scrape restaurant websites
  So that I can populate directory data

Scenario: Successful single restaurant scraping
  Given I have a valid restaurant website URL
  And I have selected default data fields
  When I execute the scraping process
  Then I should receive a properly formatted text file
  And the file should contain restaurant name, address, and phone
  And the file should follow PDF format guide standards
```

#### 12.3.4 Mock-Driven Testing
**Purpose**: Test custom code without external dependencies
**Coverage Target**: 100% of external interaction wrapper code

**Mock Implementation Strategy**:
```python
class TestWebScraper:
    @mock.patch('requests.get')
    def test_scrape_restaurant_page_success(self, mock_get):
        """Red: Test successful page scraping with mocked response"""
        # Setup mock response
        mock_get.return_value.text = load_test_html('restaurant_sample.html')
        mock_get.return_value.status_code = 200
        
        # Execute scraping
        scraper = RestaurantScraper()
        result = scraper.scrape_url("http://test-restaurant.com")
        
        # Validate custom extraction logic
        assert result.name == "Expected Restaurant Name"
        assert mock_get.called_once_with("http://test-restaurant.com")
```

**Mock Testing Requirements**:
- All HTTP requests mocked for deterministic testing
- File system operations mocked for isolation
- External service calls replaced with controlled responses
- Network failure scenarios simulated through mock exceptions

### 12.4 Test Data Management

#### 12.4.1 Test Data Strategy
**Approach**: Comprehensive test data sets covering real-world scenarios

**Test Data Categories**:
- **HTML Samples**: Representative restaurant website structures
- **Edge Cases**: Malformed HTML, missing data, unusual formatting
- **Error Scenarios**: Network failures, timeouts, access denied
- **Configuration Variants**: All possible user setting combinations

**Test Data Organization**:
```
tests/
├── data/
│   ├── html_samples/
│   │   ├── standard_restaurant.html
│   │   ├── chain_location.html
│   │   ├── minimal_info.html
│   │   └── malformed_structure.html
│   ├── expected_outputs/
│   │   ├── standard_restaurant.txt
│   │   └── chain_location.txt
│   └── configurations/
│       ├── default_config.json
│       └── all_fields_config.json
```

### 12.7 Performance Testing with TDD

#### 12.7.1 Performance Test Development
**TDD Approach for Performance**:
1. **Red**: Write failing performance tests with specific thresholds
2. **Green**: Implement code that meets minimum performance requirements
3. **Refactor**: Optimize while maintaining performance test compliance

**Performance Test Categories**:
- **Scraping Speed**: Individual page processing time limits
- **Memory Usage**: Maximum memory consumption thresholds
- **Batch Processing**: Multiple URL processing efficiency
- **File Generation**: Output file creation speed requirements

#### 12.7.2 Load Testing Implementation
**Test-Driven Load Testing**:
```python

    """Red: Test batch processing meets performance requirements"""
    urls = generate_test_urls(50)  # 50 test restaurant URLs
    start_time = time.time()
    
    results = batch_scrape_restaurants(urls)
    
    end_time = time.time()
    processing_time = end_time - start_time
    
    # Performance assertions
    assert processing_time < 300  # Less than 5 minutes for 50 URLs
    assert len(results.successful_extractions) >= 45  # 90% success rate
    assert memory_usage() < 500_000_000  # Less than 500MB RAM

def test_pdf_generation_performance():
    """Red: Test PDF generation meets performance requirements"""
    restaurant_data = generate_test_restaurant_data(100)  # 100 restaurants
    pdf_config = PDFConfiguration()
    
    start_time = time.time()
    pdf_content = generate_pdf_batch(restaurant_data, pdf_config)
    end_time = time.time()
    
    generation_time = end_time - start_time
    
    # PDF performance assertions
    assert generation_time < 10  # Less than 10 seconds for 100 restaurants
    assert len(pdf_content) > 10000  # Reasonable PDF size
    assert memory_usage_increase() < 200_000_000  # Less than 200MB additional RAM

def test_dual_format_generation_performance():
    """Red: Test simultaneous text and PDF generation"""
    restaurant_data = generate_test_restaurant_data(50)
    
    start_time = time.time()
    text_content, pdf_content = generate_dual_format(restaurant_data)
    end_time = time.time()
    
    total_time = end_time - start_time
    
    # Dual format performance assertions
    assert total_time < 15  # Less than 15 seconds for both formats
    assert text_content is not None
    assert pdf_content is not None
    assert validate_content_consistency(text_content, pdf_content)

def test_pdf_memory_efficiency():
    """Red: Test PDF generation memory usage stays within limits"""
    large_restaurant_data = generate_test_restaurant_data(500)
    
    initial_memory = memory_usage()
    pdf_content = generate_pdf_batch(large_restaurant_data, PDFConfiguration())
    peak_memory = memory_usage()
    
    memory_increase = peak_memory - initial_memory
    
    # Memory efficiency assertions
    assert memory_increase < 300_000_000  # Less than 300MB for 500 restaurants
    assert pdf_content is not None
    assert validate_pdf_structure(pdf_content)
