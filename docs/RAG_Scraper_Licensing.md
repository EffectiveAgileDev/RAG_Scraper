I want to make a demo application out of RAG Scraper that supports a licensed version.  What is the 
  best way to do that, do not start the implmenation until I have OK'd it.

‚óè Great idea! Let me outline a strategy for creating a demo application with licensing support for RAG
  Scraper. Here are the best approaches:

  Option 1: Freemium SaaS Model (Recommended)

  Demo Version Limitations:

  - URL Limit: 5-10 URLs per session vs unlimited in licensed version
  - Export Formats: Text only vs full JSON/PDF/WTEG export options
  - AI Enhancement: Basic analysis vs advanced custom questions
  - Batch Processing: Single URL vs multi-URL processing
  - Data Retention: Session-only vs persistent storage

  Technical Implementation:

  - Feature Flags: Environment variables controlling feature availability
  - License Validation: JWT tokens or API key validation
  - Usage Tracking: Session-based counters for demo limits
  - Upgrade Prompts: Strategic placement when limits are reached

  Option 2: Time-Limited Trial

  Demo Approach:

  - 30-day Trial: Full features with time expiration
  - License Keys: Generated trial keys vs permanent licensed keys
  - Hardware Fingerprinting: Prevent trial abuse
  - Automatic Expiration: Features disable after trial period

  Option 3: Hybrid Desktop + Web

  Architecture:

  - Demo Web Version: Limited features, runs on your servers
  - Licensed Desktop: Full features, runs locally with license validation
  - Offline Capability: Licensed version works without internet
  - Enterprise On-Premise: Full deployment for licensed customers

  Recommended Technology Stack:

  Frontend Modifications:

  - Add licensing UI components to existing Flask interface
  - Usage meters and upgrade prompts
  - License key input forms
  - Feature comparison tables

  Backend Enhancements:

  - License validation middleware
  - Usage tracking database
  - Feature toggle system
  - Payment integration (Stripe/PayPal)

  Deployment Options:

  1. Docker Containers: Easy deployment for licensed customers
  2. Electron App: Desktop version with licensing
  3. Cloud Deployment: Demo on your infrastructure

  Licensing Models to Consider:

  Pricing Tiers:

  - Demo: Free, limited features
  - Pro: $29/month, enhanced features
  - Enterprise: $99/month, full features + support
  - One-Time License: $299, perpetual desktop license

  License Validation:

  - Online Validation: Periodic license server checks
  - Offline Grace Period: 7-30 days without validation
  - Hardware Binding: Prevent license sharing
  - Floating Licenses: For enterprise teams

  Implementation Strategy:

  Phase 1: Demo Preparation

  1. Add feature flags to existing codebase
  2. Implement usage tracking
  3. Create licensing UI components
  4. Add upgrade prompts

  Phase 2: License System

  1. License generation and validation
  2. Payment processing integration
  3. Customer portal for license management
  4. Automated provisioning

  Phase 3: Distribution

  1. Docker images for licensed customers
  2. Installer packages (Windows/Mac/Linux)
  3. Documentation and onboarding
  4. Support system setup

  Revenue Optimization:

  Demo-to-Paid Conversion:

  - Value Demonstration: Show powerful results in demo
  - Strategic Limitations: Frustration points that drive upgrades
  - Clear Value Proposition: ROI calculator for time savings
  - Customer Success Stories: Testimonials and case studies

  Questions for You:

  1. Target Market: Small businesses, enterprises, or developers?
  2. Deployment Preference: SaaS, desktop, or both?
  3. Pricing Strategy: Subscription vs one-time purchase?
  4. Demo Scope: How limited should the free version be?
  5. Technical Constraints: Any existing infrastructure preferences?

  Which option appeals to you most? I can then create a detailed implementation plan with specific code 
  changes and architecture decisions.
