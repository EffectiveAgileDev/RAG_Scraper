# Add Industry Feature - Implementation Plan

## Overview
Enable administrators to dynamically add new industry types and their associated schemas to the RAG Scraper application, expanding beyond the current Restaurant/RestW support.

## Current State
- Application currently hardcoded for Restaurant industry with two schemas: "Restaurant" and "RestW"
- Industry configurations stored in `src/config/industry_status.json`
- Industry logic embedded in multiple components

## Phase 1: Backend Infrastructure (Foundation)

### 1.1 Data Model Enhancement
- [ ] Create new database schema for dynamic industries
  - Industry table: id, name, display_name, help_text, status, created_at, updated_at
  - Schema table: id, industry_id, schema_name, schema_definition, is_active
  - Industry_categories table: id, industry_id, category_name, display_order
- [ ] Create migration scripts for existing data
- [ ] Add validation models for industry and schema data

### 1.2 Configuration Management
- [ ] Refactor `IndustryConfig` class to support dynamic loading
- [ ] Create `IndustrySchemaManager` class for schema operations
- [ ] Implement JSON schema validation for industry schemas
- [ ] Add industry template system for common patterns

### 1.3 API Endpoints
- [ ] POST `/api/admin/industries` - Create new industry
- [ ] GET `/api/admin/industries` - List all industries
- [ ] PUT `/api/admin/industries/{id}` - Update industry
- [ ] DELETE `/api/admin/industries/{id}` - Delete industry
- [ ] POST `/api/admin/industries/{id}/schemas` - Add schema to industry
- [ ] PUT `/api/admin/industries/{id}/schemas/{schema_id}` - Update schema

## Phase 2: Admin Interface (UI)

### 2.1 Admin Dashboard
- [ ] Create admin authentication and authorization
- [ ] Build admin navigation menu
- [ ] Design industry management dashboard
- [ ] Implement role-based access control

### 2.2 Industry Management UI
- [ ] Create "Add Industry" form with fields:
  - Industry name
  - Display name
  - Help text
  - Default categories
  - Initial status (active/inactive)
- [ ] Build industry listing page with search/filter
- [ ] Add edit/delete functionality
- [ ] Implement industry preview feature

### 2.3 Schema Builder
- [ ] Create visual schema builder interface
- [ ] Add JSON schema editor with syntax highlighting
- [ ] Implement schema validation preview
- [ ] Add import/export schema functionality
- [ ] Create schema templates library

## Phase 3: Scraper Integration

### 3.1 Dynamic Scraper Loading
- [ ] Refactor scraper factory to load industries dynamically
- [ ] Create base scraper class with extensible methods
- [ ] Implement schema-driven extraction logic
- [ ] Add custom extractor plugin system

### 3.2 Extraction Rules Engine
- [ ] Build rule definition system for each industry
- [ ] Create mapping between schema fields and extraction patterns
- [ ] Implement fallback extraction strategies
- [ ] Add AI-assisted field mapping suggestions

### 3.3 Testing Framework
- [ ] Create automated testing for new industries
- [ ] Build validation suite for schemas
- [ ] Implement sample URL testing interface
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks for extractors

## Phase 4: User Experience Updates

### 4.1 Frontend Integration
- [ ] Update industry dropdown to load dynamically
- [ ] Modify form validation for industry-specific fields
- [ ] Update progress indicators for new industries
- [ ] Enhance error messages for industry-specific issues

### 4.2 Output Generation
- [ ] Adapt text file generation for dynamic schemas
- [ ] Update PDF generation templates
- [ ] Create industry-specific output formats
- [ ] Add custom field formatting options

### 4.3 Knowledge Base Integration
- [ ] Extend `IndustryDatabase` for dynamic industries
- [ ] Build term mapping interface for new industries
- [ ] Create industry-specific synonym management
- [ ] Add bulk import for industry knowledge

## Phase 5: Advanced Features

### 5.1 Schema Versioning
- [ ] Implement schema version control
- [ ] Add migration tools for schema updates
- [ ] Create rollback functionality
- [ ] Build compatibility checking

### 5.2 Industry Marketplace
- [ ] Create industry template sharing system
- [ ] Build community schema repository
- [ ] Add rating/review system for schemas
- [ ] Implement schema certification process

### 5.3 Analytics and Monitoring
- [ ] Add industry usage statistics
- [ ] Track extraction success rates by industry
- [ ] Create performance dashboards
- [ ] Implement anomaly detection for failures

## Phase 6: Documentation and Deployment

### 6.1 Documentation
- [ ] Write admin user guide
- [ ] Create schema development documentation
- [ ] Build API documentation
- [ ] Add troubleshooting guides

### 6.2 Migration Tools
- [ ] Create data migration scripts
- [ ] Build rollback procedures
- [ ] Add backup/restore functionality
- [ ] Implement gradual rollout system

### 6.3 Testing and QA
- [ ] Comprehensive integration testing
- [ ] Load testing with multiple industries
- [ ] Security audit for admin features
- [ ] User acceptance testing

## Technical Considerations

### Security
- Admin authentication required
- Schema validation to prevent injection
- Rate limiting on admin endpoints
- Audit logging for all changes

### Performance
- Lazy loading of industries
- Caching strategy for schemas
- Optimized database queries
- Background processing for heavy operations

### Scalability
- Design for 100+ industries
- Efficient schema storage
- Distributed extraction capability
- Horizontal scaling support

## Success Metrics
- Number of industries successfully added
- Extraction accuracy for new industries
- Time to add new industry (target: <30 minutes)
- Admin user satisfaction score
- System performance with multiple industries

## Risk Mitigation
- Backward compatibility with existing Restaurant/RestW
- Gradual rollout with feature flags
- Comprehensive backup before migrations
- Rollback plan for each phase

## Estimated Timeline
- Phase 1: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 2: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 3: 3-4 weeks
- Phase 4: 2-3 weeks
- Phase 5: 4-5 weeks
- Phase 6: 2-3 weeks

Total: 16-22 weeks (4-5.5 months)

## Dependencies
- Database upgrade may be required
- Admin authentication system needed
- UI framework decision for admin panel
- Schema validation library selection

## Next Steps
1. Review and approve implementation plan
2. Prioritize phases based on business needs
3. Assign development resources
4. Create detailed technical specifications
5. Set up development environment for admin features
