# Post-Refactoring Changes

This document tracks changes that should be made after the refactoring process is complete.

## Test Environment Improvements

### Add Tesseract OCR to requirements.txt
- **Issue**: Two tests are failing due to Tesseract OCR not being available in the test environment
- **Failing Tests**: 
  - `test_real_tesseract_ocr_integration`
  - `test_tesseract_availability_detection`
- **Solution**: Add `pytesseract` and system dependency instructions to requirements.txt so that all tests pass
- **Impact**: Ensures complete test coverage for OCR functionality
- **Priority**: Low (OCR is not required for core functionality)
