Web URL Scraping (Much Better Results)

  ✅ Advantages:
  1. Complete Menu Extraction: 150+ menu items extracted, including full categories
  (breakfast, lunch, dinner, cocktails, appetizers, desserts)
  2. Proper Restaurant Name: "Metropolitan Tavern" (complete and accurate)
  3. Rich Data Sources: Access to live website with structured HTML, JSON-LD metadata,
  and microdata
  4. Social Media Links: Found Facebook and Instagram URLs
  5. Multiple Cuisine Types: "Bbq, French, Seafood"
  6. Comprehensive Coverage: Captures entire menu across all sections

  PDF Upload Processing (Limited Results)

  ❌ Limitations:
  1. Missing Menu Items: Often empty menu_items arrays
  2. Incomplete Names: "Coffee Shop" instead of "Fuller's Coffee Shop"
  3. Limited Context: PDFs contain only static text, missing structured web metadata
  4. Text Extraction Issues: PDF text parsing can miss formatting and context
  5. No Social Media: PDFs don't contain live web links

  Technical Reasons for the Difference

  Web Scraping Pipeline:
  - Uses BeautifulSoup4 and requests-html for rich HTML parsing
  - Extracts JSON-LD structured data directly from websites
  - Accesses microdata and semantic markup
  - Can process dynamic content and multiple page sections
  - Built-in restaurant-specific pattern recognition for web content

  PDF Processing Pipeline:
  - Relies on PyPDF2 text extraction (limited formatting preservation)
  - Uses pattern recognizer on plain text (more error-prone)
  - No access to structured metadata or web context
  - Text may be fragmented or poorly formatted from PDF conversion

  The web scraping approach leverages the restaurant's live website data structure,
  while PDF processing works with static, potentially poorly-formatted text extraction.
   This explains why web scraping produces much richer, more complete results.
