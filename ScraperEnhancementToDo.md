### UI and Frontend Defects
- [x] **Industry Dropdown Styling**: Fixed white background making options unreadable
  - **Issue**: Industry dropdown had white text on white background
  - **Solution**: Added `terminal-input` CSS class, enhanced CSS with `!important` declarations
  - **Test**: `TestIndustryDropdownStyling` (3 tests)

- [x] **ALL Dropdowns White Background**: Fixed CSS and JavaScript enforcement for consistent gray styling
  - **Issue**: All select dropdowns (industry, aggregation mode) showing white backgrounds after page load
  - **Solution**: Enhanced CSS with browser-specific overrides, JavaScript enforcement with MutationObserver
  - **Test**: `TestAllDropdownsStylingDefect` (4 tests)

- [x] **Industry Validation Missing**: Fixed form submission not including industry field
  - **Issue**: "Please select an industry before scraping" error despite selection
  - **Solution**: Updated JavaScript form submission to include `industry` field in request payload
  - **Test**: `TestIndustryValidationDefect` (4 tests)

- [x] **URL Splitting on Newlines/Spaces**: Fixed regex pattern for robust URL separation
  - **Issue**: URLs separated by spaces or newlines not being split correctly
  - **Solution**: Enhanced regex pattern `/[\n\s]+/` for flexible URL separation
  - **Test**: `TestURLSplittingDefect` (4 tests)

- [x] **URL Concatenation with Quotes**: Fixed space-separated URLs being processed as single concatenated URL
  - **Issue**: URLs like `"url1" and "url2"` being treated as one malformed URL
  - **Solution**: Implemented regex URL extraction to handle quoted and mixed content
  - **Test**: `test_url_concatenation_with_quotes_defect`, `test_space_separated_urls_concatenation_defect`

- [x] **Space-Separated URLs Bug**: Fixed double backslash (`\\n`) preventing proper URL splitting
  - **Issue**: JavaScript using `split('\\n')` instead of `split('\n')` for newline separation
  - **Solution**: Applied regex URL extraction to both locations in HTML template
  - **Test**: `test_single_url_recognition_defect`, `test_unknown_error_in_scraping_defect`

### Data Extraction Defects
- [x] **Incomplete Data Export**: Fixed missing basic info fields (address, phone, hours, website)
  - **Issue**: Export showing empty/null values for basic restaurant information
  - **Solution**: Enhanced HeuristicExtractor with JavaScript `pageData` support
  - **Test**: `TestIncompleteDataExportDefect` (5 tests)

- [x] **Duplicate Restaurant Data**: Fixed identical data from different URLs
  - **Issue**: Multiple URLs producing identical "Portland", "Bbq" results
  - **Solution**: Added URL-based restaurant selection from JavaScript arrays
  - **Test**: `test_duplicate_restaurant_data`, `test_mobimag_urls_parsing_failure`

- [x] **JavaScript Data Extraction**: Enhanced HeuristicExtractor with JavaScript `pageData` support
  - **Issue**: mobimag.co URLs using JavaScript-rendered content not being extracted
  - **Solution**: Added `_extract_from_javascript()` method with URL decoding
  - **Test**: Comprehensive acceptance tests in `test_mobimag_extraction.py`

- [x] **URL-Based Restaurant Selection**: Added URL path parsing to select correct restaurant from data array
  - **Issue**: URL path (`/6`, `/7`) not being used to select specific restaurant from JavaScript array
  - **Solution**: Added `_extract_restaurant_id_from_url()` and `_find_restaurant_index()` methods
  - **Test**: URL-based selection tests with confidence scoring

- [x] **mobimag.co Specific Issues**: Fixed extraction from JavaScript-rendered content
  - **Issue**: Customer site mobimag.co returning generic "Unknown error" for valid URLs
  - **Solution**: Complete JavaScript extraction pipeline with structured data mapping
  - **Result**: Now extracts "Kells Irish Pub Downtown" vs "Mucca Osteria" instead of duplicate "Portland"

### Testing Coverage
- [x] **Unit Tests for All Defects**: Created 28 comprehensive unit tests documenting and preventing regression
  - **Files**: `test_ui_defects.py` (18 tests), `test_data_export_defects.py` (5 tests), `test_mobimag_extraction.py` (5 tests)
  - **Coverage**: All manual testing defects documented with unit tests
  - **TDD Process**: All defects resolved using Red-Green-Refactor methodology
