# Restaurant Scraper Investigation Summary

## Issue Analysis: mettavern.com Extraction Failure

### Root Cause Found
The primary issue was a **bug in the `MultiStrategyScraper._merge_extraction_results()` method** where an undefined `url` variable was being used, causing the scraper to crash before returning any data.

**Location:** `/home/rod/AI/Projects/RAG_Scraper/src/scraper/multi_strategy_scraper.py` line 213

**Error:** `NameError: name 'url' is not defined`

### Bug Details
```python
# BEFORE (buggy code)
def _merge_extraction_results(
    self,
    json_ld_results: List[JSONLDExtractionResult],
    microdata_results: List[MicrodataExtractionResult], 
    heuristic_results: List[HeuristicExtractionResult],
) -> Optional[RestaurantData]:
    # ... processing logic ...
    merged = RestaurantData(name=base_result.name, sources=sources, website=url)  # ❌ url undefined
```

```python
# AFTER (fixed code)
def _merge_extraction_results(
    self,
    json_ld_results: List[JSONLDExtractionResult],
    microdata_results: List[MicrodataExtractionResult],
    heuristic_results: List[HeuristicExtractionResult],
    url: Optional[str] = None,  # ✅ Added url parameter
) -> Optional[RestaurantData]:
    # ... processing logic ...
    merged = RestaurantData(name=base_result.name, sources=sources, website=url)  # ✅ url now defined
```

### Extraction System Analysis

The restaurant scraper uses a **three-tier extraction strategy**:

1. **JSON-LD Extraction** (Highest Priority)
   - Looks for structured schema.org data in `<script type="application/ld+json">` tags
   - Types: Restaurant, FoodEstablishment, LocalBusiness
   - **mettavern.com result:** 0 results (no structured data found)

2. **Microdata Extraction** (Medium Priority) 
   - Looks for schema.org microdata markup with `itemscope` and `itemtype`
   - **mettavern.com result:** 0 results (no microdata markup found)

3. **Heuristic Extraction** (Lowest Priority)
   - Uses pattern matching for phones, addresses, hours, names, etc.
   - **mettavern.com result:** ✅ Successfully extracted restaurant data

### Working Extraction Results for mettavern.com

After fixing the bug, the scraper successfully extracts:

```
✅ SUCCESS: Restaurant data extracted
Name: Metropolitan Tavern
Address: 1021 Northeast Grand Avenue Portland, OR 97232
Phone: (503) 963-3600
Confidence: medium
Sources: heuristic
Website: https://mettavern.com
Hours: Monday-Friday 11:00am-11:00pmSaturday & Sunday 9:30am-11:00pm
Cuisine: Pizza
Social Media: 2 links
```

## Additional Improvements Made

### 1. Enhanced Address Normalization
**File:** `/home/rod/AI/Projects/RAG_Scraper/src/scraper/pattern_matchers.py`

Added `normalize_address()` method to fix common spacing issues:
- "AvenuePortland" → "Avenue Portland" 
- "Portland, OR97232" → "Portland, OR 97232"
- Proper comma spacing
- Multiple space cleanup

### 2. Enhanced Hours Normalization  
**File:** `/home/rod/AI/Projects/RAG_Scraper/src/scraper/pattern_matchers.py`

Added `normalize_hours()` method to clean up hours formatting:
- Remove "Hours" prefix if present
- Clean up day range spacing: "Monday - Friday" → "Monday-Friday"
- Clean up time range spacing: "11:00am - 11:00pm" → "11:00am-11:00pm"

### 3. Debug Tool Created
**File:** `/home/rod/AI/Projects/RAG_Scraper/debug_extraction.py`

Created comprehensive debugging tool that:
- Tests each extraction method individually
- Shows validation results and confidence scores
- Provides detailed failure analysis
- Can be used to test any restaurant URL

## Key Files Modified

1. **`/home/rod/AI/Projects/RAG_Scraper/src/scraper/multi_strategy_scraper.py`**
   - Fixed undefined `url` parameter bug
   - Lines 174-176 and 180-186

2. **`/home/rod/AI/Projects/RAG_Scraper/src/scraper/pattern_matchers.py`**
   - Added `normalize_address()` method
   - Added `normalize_hours()` method
   - Updated calls to use new normalization methods

3. **`/home/rod/AI/Projects/RAG_Scraper/debug_extraction.py`** (NEW)
   - Comprehensive debugging tool for extraction analysis

## Validation Requirements

The extraction system requires:
- **Minimum:** Restaurant name must be present and non-empty
- **Validation:** `result.is_valid()` checks `bool(self.name and self.name.strip())`
- **Confidence Scoring:** Based on number of fields extracted and data source quality

## Restaurant Page Detection

The heuristic extractor uses multiple criteria to identify restaurant pages:
- Restaurant-related keywords in content (menu, restaurant, dining, food, etc.)
- Title tag indicators 
- Heading tag indicators
- Meta tag indicators
- Minimum content length (>100 characters)

**mettavern.com detection:** ✅ Correctly identified as restaurant page

## Debugging Strategy for Other Sites

To debug other failing restaurant sites:

1. **Run the debug tool:**
   ```bash
   python debug_extraction.py https://example-restaurant.com
   ```

2. **Check each extraction method:**
   - JSON-LD: Look for structured data availability
   - Microdata: Check for schema.org markup
   - Heuristic: Verify restaurant page detection and pattern matching

3. **Common failure points:**
   - Page not identified as restaurant (check keywords)
   - No valid name extracted (check title tag, H1 elements)
   - Pattern matching issues (check regex patterns)
   - Validation failures (ensure name field is populated)

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor for similar bugs** in other extraction components
2. **Enhance pattern matching** for edge cases discovered during testing
3. **Add more robust validation** for extracted data
4. **Consider adding logging** for production debugging
5. **Test debug tool** on other restaurant websites to identify additional patterns

## Impact

This investigation and fix resolves the "No restaurant data found" issue for mettavern.com and likely fixes similar failures for other restaurant websites that rely on heuristic extraction. The enhanced normalization also improves data quality for all extracted restaurant information.
