Feature: Security and Robustness
  As a system administrator and user
  I want secure and robust operation
  So that the system can handle various inputs safely and reliably

  Background:
    Given the RAG_Scraper system is running
    And all security measures are properly configured

  Scenario: Input Validation Security
    Given I attempt to provide various malformed inputs
    When I submit forms with:
      | input_type | input_value |
      | script_injection | <script>alert('xss')</script> |
      | sql_injection | '; DROP TABLE users; -- |
      | path_traversal | ../../../etc/passwd |
      | null_bytes | test\x00.txt |
    Then all malicious inputs should be properly sanitized
    And no code execution should occur
    And appropriate error messages should be returned
    And the system should remain stable

  Scenario: Empty Data Handling
    Given I submit requests with empty or null data
    When I send:
      | endpoint | data |
      | /api/validate | {} |
      | /api/scrape | null |
      | /api/generate-file | "" |
    Then graceful error handling should occur
    And appropriate error messages should be provided
    And no system crashes should happen
    And HTTP status codes should be appropriate

  Scenario: Invalid JSON Handling
    Given I send malformed JSON to API endpoints
    When I submit requests with:
      | json_content |
      | {invalid json} |
      | {"unclosed": "quote} |
      | {"trailing": "comma",} |
      | null |
    Then JSON parsing errors should be handled gracefully
    And clear error messages should be returned
    And the system should not crash or hang

  Scenario: File System Security - Path Traversal Prevention
    Given I attempt path traversal attacks in output directories
    When I specify output directories like:
      | directory_path |
      | ../../../etc/ |
      | /etc/passwd |
      | ..\..\windows\system32 |
      | /dev/null |
    Then path traversal should be blocked
    And no unauthorized file access should occur
    And appropriate security errors should be returned

  Scenario: File System Security - Permission Validation
    Given I specify various output directories
    When I try to write to:
      | directory_type | directory_path |
      | restricted | /root/restricted |
      | non_existent | /does/not/exist |
      | read_only | /read/only/folder |
    Then permission errors should be handled gracefully
    And no unauthorized file creation should occur
    And helpful error messages should be provided

  Scenario: Security Headers Validation
    Given I make requests to any endpoint
    When I examine the HTTP response headers
    Then security headers should be present:
      | header_name | expected_value |
      | X-Content-Type-Options | nosniff |
      | X-Frame-Options | DENY |
      | X-XSS-Protection | 1; mode=block |
    And content types should be properly set
    And no sensitive information should be leaked in headers

  Scenario: Request Size Limits
    Given I attempt to send oversized requests
    When I submit requests larger than the configured limit
    Then requests should be rejected appropriately
    And no system overload should occur
    And clear error messages should explain the limits

  Scenario: File Download Security
    Given I attempt to download files via the API
    When I try to access:
      | filename | expected_result |
      | ../../../etc/passwd | blocked |
      | valid_file.txt | allowed |
      | system/file.conf | blocked |
    Then only authorized files should be downloadable
    And path traversal in filenames should be blocked
    And appropriate access controls should be enforced

  Scenario: Concurrent Request Handling
    Given I make multiple simultaneous requests
    When I send 10+ concurrent API calls
    Then the system should handle concurrent requests appropriately
    And no race conditions should occur
    And system stability should be maintained
    And responses should be consistent

  Scenario: Resource Exhaustion Protection
    Given I attempt to overwhelm the system
    When I send many rapid requests or large data sets
    Then the system should implement appropriate rate limiting
    And resource usage should be controlled
    And the system should remain responsive
    And DoS protection should be effective

  Scenario: Error Information Disclosure
    Given various error conditions occur in the system
    When errors are returned to the user
    Then error messages should not reveal sensitive system information
    And stack traces should not be exposed to end users
    And error logging should capture details for administrators
    And user-facing errors should be helpful but safe

  Scenario: Configuration Security
    Given the system is running with various configurations
    When I examine the system configuration
    Then debug mode should be disabled in production
    And secret keys should be properly generated and secured
    And no default or weak credentials should be used
    And configuration should follow security best practices

  Scenario: Input Length Validation
    Given I provide various input lengths
    When I submit:
      | field | length | content |
      | urls | very_long | 10000+ character URLs |
      | directory | excessive | 1000+ character paths |
      | json | oversized | massive JSON payloads |
    Then appropriate length limits should be enforced
    And buffer overflow protection should be active
    And clear validation messages should be provided

  Scenario: Session and State Management Security
    Given I interact with the system over time
    When I examine session handling and state management
    Then session security should be properly implemented
    And no sensitive data should persist inappropriately
    And state should be properly isolated between users
    And cleanup should occur when sessions end
