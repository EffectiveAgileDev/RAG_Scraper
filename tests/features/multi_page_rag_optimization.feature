Feature: Multi-Page RAG-Optimized Output
  As a RAG system developer
  I want to generate RAG-optimized output from multi-page scraped data
  So that I can achieve better retrieval performance with cross-page context awareness

  Background:
    Given I have restaurant data extracted from multiple related pages
    And the data includes parent-child page relationships with provenance metadata
    And each entity has cross-page references and context inheritance
    And I have a configured multi-page RAG optimizer

  Scenario: Generate cross-page coherent semantic chunks
    Given I have restaurant data spanning directory and detail pages
    And the data includes overlapping information across pages
    When I generate RAG-optimized chunks with cross-page coherence
    Then chunks should maintain semantic coherence across source pages
    And overlapping information should be deduplicated intelligently
    And chunk boundaries should respect page relationship hierarchies
    And each chunk should include multi-page provenance metadata

  Scenario: Create context-bridging chunks for related pages
    Given I have a restaurant directory page and multiple detail pages
    And the detail pages reference information from the directory
    When I generate context-bridging chunks
    Then chunks should preserve context that spans multiple pages
    And directory context should be included in detail page chunks
    And cross-page references should be maintained within chunks
    And chunk metadata should track all contributing source pages

  Scenario: Optimize chunk boundaries for page relationships
    Given I have hierarchical restaurant data with parent-child pages
    When I generate chunks with page-relationship awareness
    Then chunk boundaries should align with page hierarchy
    And parent page context should be preserved in child page chunks
    And sibling page relationships should be maintained
    And chunk size should adapt to preserve page relationship integrity

  Scenario: Generate multi-page embedding optimization hints
    Given I have restaurant data aggregated from multiple pages
    When I generate embedding hints for multi-page content
    Then hints should include keywords from all contributing pages
    And page-specific context should be preserved in hints
    And cross-page entity relationships should be reflected in hints
    And hints should optimize for multi-page retrieval scenarios

  Scenario: Create RAG-friendly cross-page section markers
    Given I have multi-page restaurant content with complex relationships
    When I generate output with cross-page section markers
    Then section markers should indicate page transitions
    And markers should preserve cross-page context flow
    And RAG systems should be able to identify page boundaries
    And section markers should include page relationship metadata

  Scenario: Handle multi-page temporal consistency in chunks
    Given I have restaurant data extracted at different times from multiple pages
    When I generate temporally-aware RAG chunks
    Then chunks should include temporal metadata for each source page
    And conflicting information should be resolved with temporal awareness
    And most recent data should be prioritized in chunk content
    And chunk metadata should track extraction timeline across pages

  Scenario: Optimize for multi-page retrieval scenarios
    Given I have comprehensive restaurant data from directory and detail pages
    When I optimize output for multi-page RAG retrieval
    Then content should be optimized for cross-page queries
    And related information should be co-located in retrievable chunks
    And page hierarchy should enhance retrieval ranking
    And chunk metadata should support multi-page query expansion

  Scenario: Generate cross-page entity disambiguation
    Given I have restaurant entities that appear on multiple pages
    When I generate RAG-optimized output with entity disambiguation
    Then entities should be clearly disambiguated across pages
    And entity references should include page-specific context
    And cross-page entity relationships should be explicit
    And disambiguation should enhance RAG precision

  Scenario: Create multi-page context preservation markers
    Given I have restaurant data with inherited context from parent pages
    When I generate output with multi-page context preservation
    Then inherited context should be explicitly marked in chunks
    And context sources should be traceable to originating pages
    And context inheritance rules should be documented in chunks
    And preservation markers should enhance RAG context understanding

  Scenario: Handle large-scale multi-page RAG optimization
    Given I have restaurant data from 50+ pages with complex relationships
    When I generate RAG-optimized output for large-scale data
    Then optimization should scale efficiently across all pages
    And chunk generation should maintain performance with large datasets
    And cross-page relationships should be preserved at scale
    And memory usage should remain within reasonable limits
    And the optimization process should be resumable if interrupted
