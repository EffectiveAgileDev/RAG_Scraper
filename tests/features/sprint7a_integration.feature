Feature: Sprint 7A Complete Integration and System Validation
  As a RAG system administrator
  I want all Sprint 7A features working together seamlessly
  So that I have a production-ready system with comprehensive field extraction, JSON export, and enhanced monitoring

  Background:
    Given the complete Sprint 7A system is deployed and active
    And all features are integrated and functional

  Scenario: End-to-end workflow with all Sprint 7A features
    Given I have 10 restaurant website URLs with varying data richness
    And I select "JSON only" as the export format
    And I configure comprehensive field extraction with custom field selection
    When I execute the complete scraping workflow
    Then I should see enhanced progress monitoring throughout the process
    And I should receive real-time notifications for multi-page processing
    And the system should extract all available fields from each website
    And I should receive a JSON file with structured, comprehensive restaurant data
    And the entire process should complete with production-level stability

  Scenario: JSON export with comprehensive field selection integration
    Given I have restaurant websites with rich data content
    And I select "JSON only" as the export format
    And I customize field selection to include all categories
    When I process the websites with enhanced monitoring active
    Then I should see field extraction progress for each category
    And the JSON output should contain all selected field categories in proper structure
    And field extraction and JSON generation should work seamlessly together
    And progress monitoring should accurately reflect both extraction and export phases

  Scenario: Single-choice format selection with production stability
    Given I have a large batch of 50 restaurant URLs
    And I test all three export format options sequentially
    When I process the same URLs with "Text only", then "PDF only", then "JSON only"
    Then each format should generate correctly without interference from others
    And format preferences should persist correctly between sessions
    And the system should maintain stability across format changes
    And memory management should be consistent across all format types

  Scenario: Multi-page processing with comprehensive monitoring and JSON export
    Given I have restaurant websites with multiple discoverable pages each
    And I select "JSON only" export with comprehensive field selection
    When I process these multi-page websites
    Then I should see page-by-page progress notifications
    And field extraction should aggregate data from all pages properly
    And the JSON output should indicate multi-page sources appropriately
    And data consolidation from multiple pages should be reflected in progress monitoring

  Scenario: Production stability during comprehensive feature usage
    Given I configure the system for maximum feature utilization
    And I process a challenging mix of 25 restaurant URLs including problematic sites
    When I use JSON export, comprehensive fields, and enhanced monitoring simultaneously
    Then all features should work together without conflicts
    And error recovery should function properly with detailed progress feedback
    And memory management should remain stable with all features active
    And the final JSON output should be complete and properly formatted

  Scenario: Performance validation with all Sprint 7A features enabled
    Given I have a performance test suite of 100 restaurant URLs
    And all Sprint 7A features are enabled (JSON export, comprehensive fields, enhanced monitoring)
    When I execute the performance validation
    Then processing speed should meet targets despite additional feature overhead
    And memory usage should remain within acceptable bounds
    And progress monitoring should not significantly impact performance
    And JSON generation should complete within acceptable time limits

  Scenario: Integration stability across multiple processing sessions
    Given I conduct repeated processing sessions using all Sprint 7A features
    When I process different URL sets with various format and field combinations
    Then configuration persistence should work correctly across sessions
    And the system should maintain stability over multiple uses
    And performance should remain consistent across repeated operations
    And no memory leaks or resource accumulation should occur

  Scenario: Comprehensive error handling integration
    Given I have URLs that will trigger various types of errors
    And I use JSON export with comprehensive field extraction
    When I process these problematic URLs with enhanced monitoring
    Then error notifications should be clear and actionable
    And the system should continue processing other URLs successfully
    And partial data should be handled gracefully in JSON output
    And error recovery should work seamlessly with progress monitoring

  Scenario: User experience validation with complete feature set
    Given I am using all Sprint 7A features in production mode
    When I interact with the system for data extraction tasks
    Then the interface should be intuitive and responsive
    And feature interactions should be logical and predictable
    And configuration options should be clearly presented and functional
    And the system should provide appropriate feedback for all operations
    And users should be able to accomplish tasks efficiently with the enhanced feature set

  Scenario: Sprint 7A feature compatibility with existing functionality
    Given I have the complete RAG_Scraper system with all previous sprint features
    When I use Sprint 7A features alongside existing functionality
    Then new features should integrate seamlessly with existing capabilities
    And there should be no regression in previously working functionality
    And existing configurations and preferences should remain intact
    And the enhanced system should provide backward compatibility where appropriate
    And overall system behavior should be consistent and predictable
