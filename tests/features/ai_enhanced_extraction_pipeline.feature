Feature: AI-Enhanced Data Extraction Pipeline
  As a user scraping business websites
  I want the extraction pipeline to combine traditional methods with AI analysis
  So that I can extract 10x more usable data compared to pattern matching alone

  Background:
    Given the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline is initialized
    And the Restaurant industry configuration is loaded
    And the confidence scoring system is enabled

  Scenario: Combine LLM and traditional extraction methods
    Given a restaurant webpage with structured JSON-LD data
    And the webpage contains unstructured content about ambiance
    When I run the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline
    Then the result should include JSON-LD extracted data with high confidence
    And the result should include LLM extracted ambiance data with medium confidence
    And the extraction methods should be tracked as ["json_ld", "llm"]
    And the combined confidence score should be higher than individual methods

  Scenario: Handle large webpage content efficiently
    Given a restaurant webpage with 5000+ words of content
    And the webpage contains multiple sections (menu, about, reviews)
    When I run the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline with performance monitoring
    Then the extraction should complete within 30 seconds
    And the LLM should process content in manageable chunks
    And all extraction methods should run in parallel
    And memory usage should remain under reasonable limits

  Scenario: Ensure data consistency across extraction methods
    Given a restaurant webpage with overlapping information
    And JSON-LD contains basic restaurant info
    And heuristic patterns detect menu items
    And LLM extracts detailed descriptions
    When I run the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline
    Then overlapping data should be merged intelligently
    And conflicting information should be resolved using confidence scores
    And the final result should contain no duplicate information
    And data source attribution should be maintained for each field

  Scenario: Fallback gracefully when AI services fail
    Given a restaurant webpage with good structured data
    And the LLM service is unavailable
    When I run the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline
    Then traditional extraction methods should still work
    And the result should indicate AI extraction was unavailable
    And the overall extraction should not fail
    And confidence scores should reflect the limited extraction methods

  Scenario: Track extraction method performance and reliability
    Given multiple restaurant webpages with varying data quality
    When I run the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline on all pages
    Then extraction method statistics should be tracked
    And success rates per method should be calculated
    And confidence score distributions should be recorded
    And method performance metrics should be available
    And the system should suggest optimal method combinations

  Scenario: Handle industry-specific extraction optimizations
    Given a medical practice webpage with specialized terminology
    And the Medical industry configuration is loaded
    When I run the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline
    Then the LLM should use medical industry prompts
    And confidence scoring should use medical industry weights
    And extraction should focus on medical-specific categories
    And the result should contain medical industry structured data

  Scenario: Integrate confidence scoring into result merging
    Given a restaurant webpage with data from multiple extraction methods
    And each method produces results with different confidence levels
    When I run the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline
    Then high confidence results should take precedence in merging
    And low confidence results should be marked as tentative
    And the final result should include overall confidence scores
    And confidence explanations should be available for debugging

  Scenario: Process batch extractions efficiently
    Given a list of 10 restaurant webpage URLs
    When I run the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline in batch mode
    Then all pages should be processed in parallel where possible
    And LLM API calls should be batched to reduce overhead
    And results should include batch processing statistics
    And individual page failures should not affect other pages
    And batch progress should be trackable

  Scenario: Support custom extraction configurations
    Given a restaurant webpage requiring specialized extraction
    And custom extraction rules are configured
    And custom confidence weights are specified
    When I run the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline with custom config
    Then the custom rules should be applied during extraction
    And confidence scoring should use the custom weights
    And the LLM should incorporate custom instructions
    And the result should reflect the customized extraction approach

  Scenario: Validate extraction results for quality assurance
    Given a restaurant webpage with known expected data
    When I run the AI-enhanced extraction pipeline
    Then the extracted data should be validated against expected schema
    And missing required fields should be flagged
    And data type inconsistencies should be detected
    And quality scores should be calculated for each extraction
    And validation errors should provide actionable feedback
