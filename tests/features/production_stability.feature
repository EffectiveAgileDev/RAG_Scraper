Feature: Production Stability Features
  As a RAG system administrator
  I want enhanced production stability and reliability
  So that the scraping system can handle real-world scenarios robustly

  Background:
    Given the RAG_Scraper web interface is running
    And I have access to the production stability monitoring system
    And the stability system is initialized

  Scenario: Enhanced error recovery and continuation mechanisms
    Given I have 8 restaurant URLs with mixed reliability
    And enhanced error recovery is enabled
    When I start the scraping process with error recovery
    And the system encounters connection failures on 3 URLs
    Then the system should automatically retry failed requests with exponential backoff
    And successful URLs should continue processing without interruption
    And the system should provide detailed error recovery logs
    And I should receive notifications about recovery attempts
    And the final results should include both successful and failed URLs with recovery details

  Scenario: Memory management optimization for large batches
    Given I have 50 restaurant URLs for memory optimization testing
    And memory management optimization is enabled
    When I start the large batch processing with memory monitoring
    Then the system should implement intelligent memory cleanup between batches
    And memory usage should not exceed 400MB during processing
    And garbage collection should be triggered proactively
    And the system should provide memory usage warnings before critical levels
    And batch processing should complete without memory overflow errors

  Scenario: Performance monitoring and optimization
    Given I have restaurant URLs with varying processing complexity
    And performance monitoring is enabled
    When I start the scraping process with performance tracking
    Then the system should track processing time per URL
    And I should see real-time performance metrics
    And the system should identify slow-performing URLs
    And performance optimization suggestions should be provided
    And processing bottlenecks should be automatically detected

  Scenario: Session persistence and recovery after crashes
    Given I am running a large batch scraping process
    And session persistence is enabled
    When the application crashes or is interrupted unexpectedly
    And I restart the application
    Then the system should detect the interrupted session
    And I should be offered the option to resume from where it stopped
    And all processed data should be preserved
    And the remaining URLs should continue processing
    And no duplicate processing should occur

  Scenario: Automatic error categorization and intelligent response
    Given I have URLs that will produce different types of errors
    And intelligent error handling is enabled
    When I start the scraping process
    And the system encounters various error types
    Then errors should be automatically categorized by type
    And each error type should trigger appropriate response strategies
    And temporary errors should trigger retry mechanisms
    And permanent errors should be logged and skipped
    And the system should learn from error patterns to improve handling

  Scenario: Production-grade logging and monitoring
    Given I have enabled production logging
    And system monitoring is active
    When I perform various scraping operations
    Then all operations should be logged with appropriate detail levels
    And error logs should include stack traces and context
    And performance metrics should be continuously collected
    And log rotation should prevent disk space issues
    And monitoring data should be exportable for analysis

  Scenario: Resource cleanup and connection management
    Given I am processing multiple restaurant websites
    And resource management is enabled
    When the scraping process completes or is interrupted
    Then all network connections should be properly closed
    And temporary files should be cleaned up automatically
    And browser resources should be released
    And memory should be garbage collected
    And no resource leaks should occur

  Scenario: Graceful degradation under system stress
    Given the system is under high load conditions
    And graceful degradation is enabled
    When system resources become limited
    Then processing speed should automatically adjust to available resources
    And non-essential features should be temporarily disabled
    And core functionality should remain operational
    And users should be informed about degraded performance
    And normal operation should resume when resources are available

  Scenario: Batch processing optimization with smart queuing
    Given I have 100 restaurant URLs for batch optimization testing
    And smart batch processing is enabled
    When I start the optimized batch processing
    Then URLs should be intelligently queued based on complexity
    And processing should be load-balanced across available resources
    And failed URLs should be automatically re-queued with lower priority
    And batch size should dynamically adjust based on system performance
    And processing efficiency should be optimized for throughput

  Scenario: Real-time system health monitoring
    Given system health monitoring is enabled
    And I am running continuous scraping operations
    When the system is actively processing URLs
    Then I should see real-time system health indicators
    And CPU usage should be monitored and displayed
    And memory usage trends should be tracked
    And network connectivity status should be shown
    And system warnings should be displayed for potential issues
    And health metrics should be logged for historical analysis

  Scenario: Comprehensive error notification system
    Given I have enabled comprehensive error notifications
    And I am processing a mixed batch of URLs
    When various types of errors occur during processing
    Then I should receive immediate notifications for critical errors
    And error notifications should include severity levels
    And suggested actions should be provided for each error type
    And error patterns should trigger preventive notifications
    And notification frequency should be intelligently managed to avoid spam
