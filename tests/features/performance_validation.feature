Feature: Performance Validation
  As a user and system administrator
  I want reliable performance under various loads
  So that the system can handle realistic workloads efficiently

  Background:
    Given the RAG_Scraper system is running
    And performance monitoring is enabled

  Scenario: Multiple Concurrent Request Performance
    Given the system is ready to handle concurrent operations
    When I submit 10 simultaneous scraping requests from different clients
    Then each request should be handled appropriately
    And system response times should remain reasonable
    And no request should be dropped or ignored
    And memory usage should remain within acceptable limits
    And CPU usage should be managed efficiently

  Scenario: Large Batch Processing Performance
    Given I have a large batch of 20+ restaurant URLs
    When I submit all URLs for batch processing
    Then all URLs should be processed successfully
    And progress tracking should remain accurate throughout
    And memory usage should scale appropriately with batch size
    And processing time should be reasonable for the batch size
    And the system should not experience memory leaks

  Scenario: File Generation Performance at Scale
    Given I have scraped data from 15+ restaurants
    When I generate files for all restaurant data simultaneously
    Then file generation should complete in reasonable time
    And both text and PDF generation should perform adequately
    And memory usage should remain controlled during file generation
    And disk I/O should be efficient
    And system responsiveness should be maintained

  Scenario: Memory Management Under Load
    Given I process multiple large batches sequentially
    When I monitor system memory usage over time
    Then memory usage should not continuously increase
    And garbage collection should occur appropriately
    And no memory leaks should be detected
    And system should recover memory after operations complete
    And baseline memory usage should be restored between operations

  Scenario: Response Time Performance
    Given the system is under normal load
    When I measure response times for various operations:
      | operation | expected_max_time |
      | URL validation | 2 seconds |
      | Single URL scraping | 10 seconds |
      | File generation | 5 seconds |
      | Progress updates | 1 second |
    Then response times should meet performance targets
    And 95th percentile response times should be acceptable
    And no operation should timeout unexpectedly

  Scenario: Database and Storage Performance
    Given the system is handling file operations
    When I perform multiple file read/write operations
    Then disk I/O should be efficient
    And file operations should not block other processes
    And storage space should be used efficiently
    And file access times should remain reasonable

  Scenario: Network Performance Under Load
    Given multiple users are accessing the web interface
    When the system handles concurrent web requests
    Then network latency should remain low
    And bandwidth usage should be reasonable
    And no network timeouts should occur
    And static asset delivery should be efficient

  Scenario: Scalability Testing
    Given I gradually increase system load
    When I monitor performance metrics as load increases
    Then performance should degrade gracefully
    And the system should remain stable under high load
    And error rates should remain acceptable
    And no catastrophic failures should occur

  Scenario: Resource Cleanup Performance
    Given operations have completed
    When I monitor system resource cleanup
    Then temporary files should be cleaned up promptly
    And system resources should be released properly
    And no resource leaks should persist
    And system should return to baseline state

  Scenario: Progress Tracking Performance
    Given multiple scraping operations are running
    When progress updates are being generated
    Then progress tracking should not significantly impact performance
    And updates should be timely and accurate
    And progress monitoring overhead should be minimal
    And no performance bottlenecks should be created

  Scenario: Large File Generation Performance
    Given I have extensive restaurant data to process
    When I generate large output files (100+ KB)
    Then file generation should complete efficiently
    And system should handle large file operations smoothly
    And no performance degradation should occur with file size
    And both text and PDF generation should scale appropriately

  Scenario: API Performance Under Concurrent Load
    Given multiple clients are using the API simultaneously
    When I monitor API endpoint performance
    Then API response times should remain consistent
    And throughput should meet expected levels
    And no API calls should fail due to load
    And rate limiting should work effectively if implemented

  Scenario: Long-Running Operation Performance
    Given I start operations that take several minutes to complete
    When I monitor system performance during long operations
    Then system responsiveness should be maintained
    And other operations should not be significantly impacted
    And progress should be reported consistently
    And system should remain stable throughout

  Scenario: Performance Regression Detection
    Given I have baseline performance measurements
    When I run the same operations after system changes
    Then performance should not regress significantly
    And any performance changes should be within acceptable ranges
    And critical operations should maintain their performance characteristics
    And performance improvements should be measurable where expected
