Feature: Production Stability and System Hardening
  As a RAG system administrator
  I want robust error handling, recovery mechanisms, and performance optimization
  So that the system operates reliably in production environments with minimal downtime

  Background:
    Given the RAG_Scraper system is configured for production use
    And all stability features are enabled

  Scenario: Enhanced error recovery and continuation mechanisms
    Given I have a batch of 20 restaurant URLs including some problematic sites
    When I execute batch processing with error recovery enabled
    Then individual site failures should not stop the entire batch process
    And the system should automatically retry failed requests with exponential backoff
    And I should receive detailed error reports for failed extractions
    And the system should continue processing remaining URLs after errors
    And successfully processed data should be preserved even when other sites fail

  Scenario: Memory management optimization for large batches
    Given I have 100 restaurant URLs for large batch processing
    When I execute the batch with memory optimization enabled
    Then memory usage should remain stable throughout the entire process
    And memory should be released appropriately after processing each URL
    And the system should not exceed 500MB RAM during active scraping
    And memory leaks should not occur during extended processing sessions
    And garbage collection should be optimized for scraping workloads

  Scenario: Performance monitoring and optimization during production use
    Given the system is processing restaurant data in production mode
    When I monitor system performance metrics
    Then processing speed should meet performance targets (3-5 seconds per single page)
    And multi-page processing should complete within 10-30 seconds per site
    And system should maintain responsiveness during heavy processing loads
    And resource utilization should be optimized for concurrent operations
    And performance should not degrade over extended operation periods

  Scenario: User experience improvements for production stability
    Given I am using the system for production data extraction
    Then the interface should remain responsive during all processing operations
    And error messages should be user-friendly and actionable
    And system feedback should be immediate and informative
    And configuration changes should be applied without requiring restarts
    And user preferences should be preserved across sessions and interruptions

  Scenario: Robust handling of network interruptions and timeouts
    Given I have batch processing in progress during network instability
    When network connectivity is intermittent or slow
    Then the system should detect network issues automatically
    And failed requests should be retried with appropriate delays
    And processing should resume seamlessly after connectivity restoration
    And users should receive clear feedback about network-related delays
    And no data should be lost due to network interruptions

  Scenario: Production-ready error logging and monitoring
    Given the system is operating in production mode
    When various types of errors occur during processing
    Then all errors should be logged with appropriate detail levels
    And error logs should include timestamp, URL, error type, and context
    And critical errors should be distinguishable from minor issues
    And log files should be rotated and managed automatically
    And system health metrics should be trackable through logs

  Scenario: Resource cleanup and system stability during extended operation
    Given the system has been running continuously for extended periods
    When processing multiple large batches over time
    Then system resources should be properly cleaned up after each batch
    And temporary files should be removed automatically
    And database connections should be managed efficiently
    And the system should not accumulate resource leaks over time
    And performance should remain consistent across multiple processing sessions

  Scenario: Graceful degradation under high load conditions
    Given the system is under heavy processing load
    When resource constraints are encountered
    Then the system should prioritize core functionality over optional features
    And processing should continue at reduced speed rather than failing
    And users should be notified of performance limitations
    And the system should recover automatically when resources become available
    And essential operations should remain functional under all conditions

  Scenario: Data integrity protection during system failures
    Given I have critical restaurant data being processed
    When unexpected system failures or crashes occur
    Then already processed data should be preserved and recoverable
    And partial processing results should not corrupt the final output
    And the system should detect incomplete processing on restart
    And users should be able to resume processing from the last successful point
    And data consistency should be maintained across all failure scenarios

  Scenario: Production deployment readiness and configuration management
    Given the system is being prepared for production deployment
    Then all configuration options should be externalized and manageable
    And sensitive settings should be secured appropriately
    And the system should start reliably in various deployment environments
    And dependencies should be clearly documented and manageable
    And the system should provide health check endpoints for monitoring
    And deployment procedures should be documented and tested
