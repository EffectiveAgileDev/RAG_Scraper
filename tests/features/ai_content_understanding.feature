Feature: AI-Powered Advanced Content Understanding
  As a user scraping restaurant websites
  I want AI to enhance extracted data with contextual understanding
  So that I get enriched data with nutritional context, price analysis, and cuisine classification

  Background:
    Given the AI content understanding module is initialized
    And the OpenAI API is configured
    And the Restaurant industry configuration is loaded

  Scenario: Enhance menu items with nutritional context
    Given a restaurant webpage with menu items
    And the menu contains items like "Caesar Salad" and "Bacon Cheeseburger"
    When I run the AI content understanding analysis
    Then the result should include nutritional context for each menu item
    And "Caesar Salad" should have tags like ["salad", "vegetarian-option", "lighter-fare"]
    And "Bacon Cheeseburger" should have tags like ["burger", "high-calorie", "meat"]
    And each item should have estimated calorie ranges
    And dietary restrictions should be identified (gluten-free, vegan, etc.)

  Scenario: Analyze price ranges and competitive positioning
    Given a restaurant webpage with menu prices
    And the menu shows entrees ranging from $12 to $45
    And the restaurant is located in "Downtown Manhattan"
    When I run the AI price analysis
    Then the result should include overall price tier classification
    And the price tier should be "upscale" based on location and prices
    And competitive positioning analysis should be provided
    And value proposition insights should be generated
    And price-to-portion expectations should be estimated

  Scenario: Classify cuisine with cultural context
    Given a restaurant webpage describing "fusion Asian-Latin cuisine"
    And the menu contains items like "Korean BBQ Tacos" and "Miso Ramen"
    When I run the AI cuisine classification
    Then the primary cuisine should be identified as "Fusion"
    And cuisine influences should include ["Korean", "Mexican", "Japanese"]
    And cultural context should explain fusion elements
    And authenticity indicators should be provided
    And related cuisine tags should be suggested for search optimization

  Scenario: Handle ambiguous menu descriptions
    Given a restaurant webpage with creative menu descriptions
    And items are described poetically like "Ocean's Bounty" or "Garden's Whisper"
    When I run the AI content understanding analysis
    Then the AI should infer likely ingredients from context
    And "Ocean's Bounty" should be identified as likely seafood
    And "Garden's Whisper" should be identified as likely vegetarian
    And confidence scores should reflect the ambiguity
    And alternative interpretations should be provided when uncertain

  Scenario: Extract dietary accommodation information
    Given a restaurant webpage mentioning dietary accommodations
    And the page contains scattered references to gluten-free and vegan options
    When I run the AI dietary analysis
    Then comprehensive dietary accommodation data should be extracted
    And the result should include specific menu items for each dietary need
    And cross-contamination warnings should be identified if mentioned
    And the restaurant's overall dietary-friendliness should be scored
    And missing dietary information should be flagged

  Scenario: Analyze restaurant specialties and signatures
    Given a restaurant webpage emphasizing certain dishes
    And the page mentions "famous for our wood-fired pizza" multiple times
    When I run the AI specialty analysis
    Then signature dishes should be identified and ranked
    And "wood-fired pizza" should be marked as the primary specialty
    And cooking methods and unique preparations should be extracted
    And the restaurant's unique selling points should be summarized
    And recommendations for first-time visitors should be generated

  Scenario: Process multilingual menu content
    Given a restaurant webpage with multilingual menu items
    And the menu includes items in Italian like "Osso Buco" with English descriptions
    When I run the AI multilingual analysis
    Then original language items should be preserved
    And accurate translations should be provided
    And cultural significance of dishes should be explained
    And pronunciation guides should be generated for complex names
    And the cuisine's authenticity should be assessed based on language use

  Scenario: Generate structured data from unstructured content
    Given a restaurant webpage with paragraph-form menu descriptions
    And no clear structure separates appetizers, mains, and desserts
    When I run the AI structuring analysis
    Then menu items should be categorized into proper sections
    And prices should be extracted and associated with correct items
    And portion sizes should be inferred from descriptions
    And menu item relationships should be identified (combos, add-ons)
    And a structured menu object should be generated

  Scenario: Integrate with existing extraction pipeline
    Given the AI content understanding module is enabled
    And traditional extraction has already processed a webpage
    When the AI enhancement pipeline runs
    Then AI analysis should augment existing extracted data
    And no existing accurate data should be overwritten
    And AI enhancements should be clearly marked in the output
    And confidence scores should reflect combined extraction methods
    And the enhancement process should complete within 15 seconds

  Scenario: Handle API rate limits and failures gracefully
    Given the AI content understanding module is processing multiple pages
    And the OpenAI API rate limit is reached
    When the extraction continues
    Then the system should implement exponential backoff
    And already processed data should be preserved
    And the user should be notified of the delay
    And extraction should resume when rate limit resets
    And partial results should be available during processing
