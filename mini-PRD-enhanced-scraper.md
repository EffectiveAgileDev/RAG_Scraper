# Product Requirements Document: Enhanced RAG Scraper for Business Growth

## Executive Summary

The RAG Scraper currently extracts basic restaurant information using predefined patterns and structured data schemas. This PRD proposes enhancements to transform it into an AI-powered, industry-agnostic scraping platform that extracts comprehensive, semantically-rich data to help businesses attract more customers through chatbot interactions.

## Problem Statement

### Current Limitations
- **Limited Data Extraction**: Only captures basic information (name, address, phone, hours)
- **Restaurant-Only Focus**: Hardcoded for restaurant industry without flexibility
- **Pattern-Based Matching**: Misses contextual information not matching exact patterns
- **Poor Semantic Understanding**: Cannot infer relationships or understand user search intent
- **Minimal Business Value Data**: Lacks reviews, ratings, special offers, and engagement metrics

### Business Impact
- Chatbot users search using natural language, not website-specific terms
- Missing 70-80% of valuable business information
