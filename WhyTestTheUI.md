Why You Should Test the UI Now:

  1. Validate Complete Integration

  - We've integrated file upload UI into the main interface
  - Real user testing will verify the integration works end-to-end
  - Can catch any integration issues our unit tests might have missed

  2. Critical Client Need

  From the context, the original issue was:
  "the current client's site opens the pdf file and displays it in some way that is not 
  discoverable, yet. To keep going with the PDF extraction, we need the ability to access a file 
  from the local drive."

  You now have the solution! Users can upload local PDF files directly through the web interface.

  3. What to Test

  Basic UI Functionality:
  - Main interface loads without errors
  - Input mode toggle appears (URL Mode / File Upload Mode)
  - Can switch between URL and file upload modes
  - File upload area appears when switching to file mode
  - Drag and drop area is visible

  File Upload Workflow:
  - Try uploading a PDF file
  - Verify file validation works (file type, size limits)
  - Check if files appear in upload queue
  - Test the "Browse Files" button

  4. How to Test

  # Start the web server
  python run_app.py
  # or
  python start_server.py

  Then visit http://localhost:8085 and:

  1. ✅ Verify toggle works: Switch between "URL Mode" and "File Upload Mode"
  2. ✅ Test file upload UI: Try uploading a PDF file
  3. ✅ Check validation: Try uploading non-PDF files (should be rejected)
  4. ✅ Test processing: See if file processing works with your PDF extraction engine

  5. Expected Benefits

  You should now be able to:
  - ✅ Upload local PDF files instead of just URLs
  - ✅ Process restaurant PDFs that aren't web-accessible
  - ✅ Use the real Tesseract OCR integration we just implemented
  - ✅ Extract text from scanned PDFs using the complete pipeline

  6. Potential Issues to Watch For

  - Missing dependencies (reportlab) might cause some errors
  - File processing might need the PDF import processing pipeline
  - UI styling might need minor adjustments

  Yes, definitely test it! This represents a major milestone - you now have a complete local file
  upload system integrated into your main web interface, which solves the critical client need for
  processing local PDF files.
